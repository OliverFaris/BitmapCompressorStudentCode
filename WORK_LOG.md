| November 30 |   9-10pm   | I looked at the reading again to refresh my memory. I think I understand most of what I have to do in that I know that you have to just write in the number of zeros you find and then switch to 1s and so on. I explained it pretty bad but I know it. The only thing I am confused about is the reading was saying something about a maximum count and I was unsure about it. |

When you hit the max, you hit 8 bits and have to add a zero and then continue counting to compensate. I think I got `expand` to work mostly but I am not totally sure. |
